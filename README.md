# DAlbum for PHP 7
This project is a modernization of DAlbum 1.44 build 177 from http://www.dalbum.org/. It is intended to fix the multiple fatal errors, warnings and notices that are generated when running under PHP 7.

The modernization will not make DAlbum a modern product viable for new albums. It is only meant to allow you to continue running your legacy albums after migrating to PHP 7.
